## Target audience
General Public - My target audience is the general public because I feel like issues of immigration are not well known by the public. I also think there is a lot of misinformation surrounding migration and undocumented people and my hope with this project is to shine light on the true facts. I want more people to know about this topic and begin to care about it because it is a human issue. The data and stories in my project are information anyone can understand and learn. 

Policy and Education Professionals - My other target audience are policy and education professionals. I am targeting these two groups because they are at the forefront of policy issues and because they may interact more with undocumented people than the general public. Policy professionals need to know about this key issue because it surrounds and impacts many policies such as economic, social, and equity policies. Education professionals are crucial in addressing the challenges faced by undocumented individuals, particularly students enrolled in primary, secondary, or tertiary education. The impacts of immigration policies on undocumented students can significantly affect their mental and academic well-being, even if they choose not to disclose their status. Issues such as access to financial aid, internships, and other opportunities can hinder their educational journey. Given their pivotal role, educators should be well-informed about immigration policies and the challenges their students may encounter, especially for educators in immigrant heavy areas, ensuring they can provide appropriate support and advocacy.

My first two interviewees are master policy students. I chose policy students as they have been learning about how policies work, how they are passed, and are future policymakers and people who will work in the policy realm. Additionally, one of the interviewees has worked a few years in D.C. so they have been around policy a little more. My last interviewee is a secondary teacher who falls into the category of educational professionals. I am interested in the educational professional’s input and seeing if someone who is not in policy and closer to the broader general public understands the topic and feels like they can do something about it. 


*Interviewee 1: 24 year old male master’s policy student
*Interviewee 2: 24 year old female master’s policy student, worked 2 years in D.C.
*Interviewee 3: 22 year old male secondary teacher
