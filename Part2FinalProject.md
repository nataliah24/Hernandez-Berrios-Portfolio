# Storyboard
For the storyboard, I created a shorthand page. I published the storyboard privately on Shorthand and it can be accessed on the following link:
https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/d67d6b01-9707-439a-a466-925b2e2c800b/index.html 

When I move on to my final version of the project, I will work on a copy of the draft so the link above should stay the same and not change with the changes I make for Part 3. I really liked using shorthand to create a website to tell a story with my data. I think shorthand is very useful for informative presentations such as this one. It also allows you to continously update it which is nice. 

# Wireframe
For my vizualizations in my project I used Canva and Tableau to create them. Canva graphs were much easier to naviagte than Tableau ones. I think the issues I faced with Tableau was due to the fact that the Excel sheet had to perfect in order for Tableau  to understand it. In order to get my tableu to work I had to create a new Excel document for each of my graphics, the data could not be in one Excel document or one Excel document with multiple sheets. I went into my data and individually separeted and created new mini datasets. 

Furthermore, some of my data points came from published researched essays so there way no downloadable dataset but rather information within the essay that I took out and found a way to visualize.

# User research 

## Target audience
General Public - My target audience is the general public because I feel like issues of immigration are not well known by the public. I also think there is a lot of misinformation surrounding migration and undocumented people and my hope with this project is to shine light on the true facts. I want more people to know about this topic and begin to care about it because it is a human issue. The data and stories in my project are information anyone can understand and learn. 

Policy and Education Professionals - My other target audience are policy and education professionals. I am targeting these two groups because they are at the forefront of policy issues and because they may interact more with undocumented people than the general public. Policy professionals need to know about this key issue because it surrounds and impacts many policies such as economic, social, and equity policies. Education professionals are crucial in addressing the challenges faced by undocumented individuals, particularly students enrolled in primary, secondary, or tertiary education. The impacts of immigration policies on undocumented students can significantly affect their mental and academic well-being, even if they choose not to disclose their status. Issues such as access to financial aid, internships, and other opportunities can hinder their educational journey. Given their pivotal role, educators should be well-informed about immigration policies and the challenges their students may encounter, especially for educators in immigrant heavy areas, ensuring they can provide appropriate support and advocacy.

My first two interviewees are master policy students. I chose policy students as they have been learning about how policies work, how they are passed, and are future policymakers and people who will work in the policy realm. Additionally, one of the interviewees has worked a few years in D.C. so they have been around policy a little more. My last interviewee is a secondary teacher who falls into the category of educational professionals. I am interested in the educational professional’s input and seeing if someone who is not in policy and closer to the broader general public understands the topic and feels like they can do something about it. 


*Interviewee 1: 24 year old male master’s policy student
*Interviewee 2: 24 year old female master’s policy student, worked 2 years in D.C.
*Interviewee 3: 22 year old male secondary teacher 

## Interview script


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Make sure my topic is clear   | What is the topic about? |
| Make sure my topic is telling a story     | Is there enough human connection for the topic? Does it feel data heavy or is it a good balance?                |
| Are the viz's clear?     | What did you think of the data visualizations? Are they easy to understand?              |
| Connectedness    | Do the data visualizations connect to the topic? |
| Clear topic     | After looking over the presentation do you think you have a better understanding of the topic? |
| Clear Call to Action     | After looking over the presentation do you feel like you have concrete steps you can take to help the issue? |

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1                    | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|What is the topic about? | The topic is about undocumented populations living in the U.S. without proper pathways to citizenship despite contributions to the economy and society.| Undocumented immigrants in the US   |             |
|Is there enough human connection for the topic? Does it feel data heavy or is it a good balance?  | Primarily data-centric. There is one human-centered video, but that’s overlooked by graphs. Suggestion for more human connection, make the connection more clear.  | There’s a good amount of data but the data surrounds people so it feels connected to people             |             |
|What did you think of the data visualizations? Are they easy to understand?| Easy to understand. The map “Where do undocumented immigrants settle in the U.S?” is a bit wonky, however. Maybe make the map static rather than giving it the option to zoom in or out. | For the graph on undocumented population, it would be good to do a stacked bar and different colors for each population rather than 3 different graphs. It would be good to include the key on the piechart rather than on the side.      |             |
|Do the data visualizations connect to the topic?|They do.| Yes they do, they fit well with the story. |
|After looking over the presentation do you think you have a better understanding of the topic?| Indeed! | I do |
|After looking over the presentation do you feel like you have concrete steps you can take to help the issue?| Very big-picture steps. Any chance to include community-oriented suggestions to help (i.e. volunteering at a local organization/community center that helps undocumented people. Is there a database that lets you include your zipcode and it pops up with ‘local immigrant assistance centers’ near you or something like that?) | Yes, I think the call to action is very actionable. |
|What questions were you left with? Is there anything that was confusing?| The section “The Immigrant Population is just a Fraction…” is unclear whether the statistics refer to undocumented people or immigrants in general (i.e. those with green cards, visas, etc.) at least in the pie chart. Nothing confusing but primarily narrow in depiction of immigrants. | No questions, but that may be due to the fact that I’m pretty familiar with the topic surrounding undocumented immigrants. |
