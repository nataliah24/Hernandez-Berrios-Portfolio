# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! 

# About me
Hi! My name is Natalia Hernandez Berrios and I am studying M.S Public Policy and Management. I am interested in research and hope to be a research analyst. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to use Github and other technical platforms. I also look forward to learning how to tell better stories with the data given. I have had previous experience working with data such as the International Military Intervention (IMI) dataset and the Military Intervention Project (MIP) data to see the impact of U.S intervention on LATAM's economic growth. In this project I had to create my own graphs and tables and I hope that with this class I am able to polish them.
