In this assignment we chose a graphic for Makeover Monday to redesign. Below is the graphic I chose from the Eurostat page titled "Pick Up a Book and Read".

I selected the data visualization from this page because I am an avid reader and the graphic stood out to me. The things that stood out were the different line colors telling us what each line represented, and how the line graph was inside a book. At first glance, just looking at the graphic, I did not know what story it was telling. I had no idea what the numbers on the y-axis were, could they be euros, percentages, or an index levels? Upon reading the article, I realized that they were trying to tell people that books had not increased much in price compared to all other products in the EU. The article states that the price of books in the EU is "growing more slowly than the total consumer prices". It used the HICP to measure the price inflation of books and the price inflation of all products. The HICP can be seen as the consumer price index (CPI) but for all of the European Union rather than each individual country.

## Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile ##
To critique the visualization I used the Stephen Few "[Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile]([url](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf)https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf)". I ranked the graphic the following:
* Usefulness - 7
* Completeness - 5
* Perceptibility - 7
* Truthfulness - 10
* Intuitiveness - 6
* Aesthetics - 7
* Engagement - 5

Reasoning:
The visualization was not bad. The colors were not too many that it became distracting. It used colors that contrast from each other to compare the "all products" to the "books" which I liked. I think it was difficult to understand what the index was and how it was measured from the graph. All the information provided about the y-axis is that 2015 is the reference point and 2015 = 100. As someone not familiar with the graph much, it was difficult to understand what the left hand index was. Also the bottom (x-axis) was a bit hard to interpret as well because it seems as though there should be bar graphs rather than lines for the points, because as I reader I see that 2009 spans from 94, 93, and back to 95. There is no average for 2019. I would make the x-axis have lines above each number rather than in between the numbers, that way it is easier to understand what the number is for that year. I would also add an explanation about what the y-axis is. The scale at the moment cannot be understood, so I would add the units as part of the label. Maybe one could even add a side chart that explains the range of values (i.e what value is "good" or what value is "poor"). I would also re-title it to grab the reader's attention "Books have become cheaper" or something similar so readers want to see what the graph is talking about. 

Following my critique I decided to come up with some sketches to help me understand the data better and start thinking about how I can do the redesign.

### Sketches ###

Following my critique I knew I wanted to focus on the years 2015 to 2020 since the original viz was using 2015 as the reference date due to it having an HICP of 100. My sketches followed that time frame and all of them depicts the years 2015 to 2020 for the HICP for books and for all products. I wanted to keep the two-color difference for the products from the orginizal viz and so I either made one line dark and one light (as seen in Sketch 1), or the bar graphs: one lined and the other white (as seen in Sketch 2 and 3). I also played around with titles for Sketch 2 and 3, trying to find one that would suit the graphic. Sketch 1 was the simplest sketch of all of them. I did it as a way to start thinking about the data and how I could change it. In Sketch 2, I tried thinking a little bit differently on how I could re-do it and so I tried a horizontal bar graph. Then in Sketch 3, I finally settled on a normal bar graph with the column for "all products" next to the column "books". This way it was easier to compare the HICP to each other, for each of the prducts from year to year. I also added a caption to explain what the HICP was. In my third sketch I added a label to the y-axis so my readers can know what the numbers stand for. I was thinking of also making a diverging color scheme to let readers know if a value was "good" or "bad".
